<p>     A library of procedures for the generation of space-group
symmetry information is presented. In addition to its functionality
related to symmetry generation, the library also contains
procedures for deriving semi-invariant vectors and moduli from a
set of symmetry matrices, and procedures to assist in the
treatment of symmetry in reciprocal space. The library gives easy
on-line access to a total of 530 settings of all space-groups listed
in the International Tables Volume I (1952) and Volume A (1983)
(ITVA).

<p>     The design of the procedures is based on the notation
introduced by Hall [1][2], which enables unambiguous and
practically unrestricted definition of space-group, setting, and
origin. Input Hall-symbols are translated into Seitz matrices,
which, in turn, are used to generate the full set of symmetry
operations. After the input Hall-symbol has been translated, the
matrices are sorted and reduced back to an output Hall-symbol.
For a given space-group and setting, the reduction process will
always result in the same Hall-symbol, regardless of the way the
group was generated; i.e., Seitz matrices from any source may be
passed to the symmetry generating procedures and a well defined
Hall-symbol will be produced.

<p>     Part of the library is a table which associates ITVA
space-group numbers, Schoenflies symbols, Hermann-Mauguin
symbols, and Hall-symbols. This table is used in two ways.
Space-group numbers and symbols can be translated to a Hall-
symbol, which is used to generate the symmetry matrices.
Alternatively, the Hall-symbol produced by the reduction
algorithm of the library is used to find the appropriate entry in the
table. Thus, given just the symmetry matrices, the ITVA space-
group number and symbols can be obtained.

<p>     The library is written in the programming language
ANSI C.
